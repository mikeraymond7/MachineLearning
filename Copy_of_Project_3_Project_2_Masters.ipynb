        "The year is 2023. As inflation continues to impact the US economy, companies are re-evaluating their growth strategies and shifting towards a value-focused approach. For example, some companies are no longer investing as heavily in research and development or expanding into new markets in order to focus on maximizing the value of their existing products and services. Others are looking for ways to reduce costs and increase efficiency in order to maintain profitability in the face of rising inflation. These shifts in corporate strategy reflect a broader trend towards prioritizing long-term stability and sustainability over short-term growth at all costs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Many tech companies such as Facebook, Twitter, and Google are resorting to layoffs as a way to reduce costs and remain competitive in the face of economic uncertainties. As a result, they are discovering that they can operate with a smaller workforce and maintain their operations while adjusting to the new normal. Those with the right skills are still in high demand. However, these workers are now under more pressure to demonstrate their value add and show that they are worth their salary by demonstrating their ability to create more value for the company in the short-term.\n",

(https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-13/cathie-wood-risks-having-too-much-money-and-not-enough-stocks) To combat this, Woods is spending a lot of analyst hours pouring over company reports to find new investment ideas.
